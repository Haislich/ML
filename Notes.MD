# Correlation

In statistics correlation is any statistical relationship, causal or not between two random variables.
The ranges of correlation varies from -1 to 1.

# Machine learning
We say that a machine is learning when it improves its performance,without being explicitly programmed to do so, after making observations about the world.
Depending on the feedback that accompany the input there is a distinction between the types of learning:
- ## Supervised learning:
    Data contains inputs and outputs. The machine has to learn what is the hypothesis $h$ that maps inputs to outputs. Depending on the output type the problems differentiate in:
    - ### Classification: 
        When the output is a finite set of values.
    - ### Regression:
        When the output is a number.
